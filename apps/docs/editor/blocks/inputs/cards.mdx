A card can contain an image, a title, a description and several buttons.

## Display cards from variables

To display cards dynamically from variables. Make sure you have list variables. For example:

- `{{Images}}` => `["https://example.com/image1.png", "https://example.com/image2.png", "https://example.com/image3.png"]`
- `{{Titles}}` => `["Card 1", "Card 2", "Card 3"]`
- `{{Descriptions}}` => `["Description 1", "Description 2", "Description 3"]`

Simply add those variables to a single card in the flow editor and the 3 cards will be displayed in the bot.

## Save answer in variables

You can store parts of the selected card into variables. Open the Cards block settings and add a mapping, then choose what to extract and which variable to save it to. Add multiple rows if you want to store several fields.

Fields you can save:

- **Image URL**: the URL of the selected card image.
- **Title**: the selected card title.
- **Description**: the selected card description.
- **Button**: the label of the button the user clicked on the selected card.
- **Internal Value**: a hidden value defined per card, ideal for stable identifiers (IDs, slugs). Configure it in a cardâ€™s settings under "Internal value".
